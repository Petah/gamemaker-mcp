Welcome to the GameMaker user manual! This document is divided into three parts with the aim of getting you introduced to the interface and basic workings of GameMaker and general programming, before going on to more advanced usage and the functions available through our proprietary programming language GML (GameMaker Language).

To ease you into things we have created a handy Quick Start Guide, and even if you are familiar with other game creation tools we recommend that you start there to get an overview of the way that GameMaker works. You'll find GameMaker to be easy and intuitive to use and that, whatever your skill level, you will soon be making those games you've always dreamed of.

NOTE Due to the modular nature of GameMaker there are certain things that are not included in this user manual, in particular those aspects of setting up and connecting the different devices that can be supported. For up-to-date information and troubleshooting hints and tips related to the different target platforms, please see the [GameMaker Help Center](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us).
