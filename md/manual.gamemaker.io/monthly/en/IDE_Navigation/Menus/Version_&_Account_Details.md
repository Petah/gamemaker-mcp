# Version & Account Details

The top-right section of the GameMaker IDE contains details about the current version, a menu for account details and a notifications button.

This shows you the current IDE and Runtime versions. The IDE can be updated through [The Help Menu](The_Help_Menu.md) and the Runtime version can be changed from the [Runtime Feeds Preferences](../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Runtime_Feed_Preferences.md).

## Account Menu

![](../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/Account_Menu.png)This menu contains the following options:

-   **GameMaker Account**: This takes you to the GameMaker website where you can log into your account and manage it.
-   **Update License**: This updates your license details in the IDE, e.g. if you purchased something from your account, use this option to have the IDE reflect your new exports without having to restart it.
-   **Logout**: This logs you out of the IDE.
-   **Login**: This opens the log-in window so you can log into the IDE.
-   **Opera Account**: This opens your Opera account on the Opera website, if you logged into the IDE with an Opera account.
-   **GX.games**: This takes you to the GX.games website.

## Notifications

![](../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/Notification_Example.png)The Notification button is highlighted when you have a new notification. This notifies you when a new runtime update is available, and when your license expires.

Opening the Notification menu allows you to click on the runtime notification, which takes you to the [Runtime Feeds Preferences](../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Runtime_Feed_Preferences.md) where you can choose a newer runtime version.
