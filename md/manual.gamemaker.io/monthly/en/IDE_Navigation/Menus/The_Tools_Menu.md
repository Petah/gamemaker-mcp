# The Tools Menu

![The Tools Menu](../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/Tools_Menu.png)

This menu permits you to open the various stand-alone tools that are available to you within GameMaker, with the following options:

-   **Texture Groups** - This opens the [Texture Groups](../../Settings/Texture_Groups.md) window.
-   **Audio Groups** - This lets you view the [Audio Groups](../../Settings/Audio_Groups.md) window.
-   **Sound Mixer** - This lets you view the [Sound Mixer](../../IDE_Tools/Sound_Mixer.md) window.
-   **Generate Project Images** - This opens the [Generate Project Images](../../IDE_Tools/Project_Image_Generator.md) window.
-   **Create Local Package** - This opens the [Asset Packager](../../IDE_Tools/Local_Asset_Packages.md) window, so you can make and save local asset packages for future use.
-   **Import Local Package** - This opens a file explorer window where you can then select a [Local Asset Package](../../IDE_Tools/Local_Asset_Packages.md) and import it, either adding it to the current project, or creating a new project for it.
-   **Project Tool** - This opens the [Project Tool](../../IDE_Tools/Project_Tool.md), which performs conversions between current and older GameMaker project format versions.
