# Menus

|  |  |
| --- | --- |

The top of the GameMaker IDE is occupied by the **Menu Bar**. Here you can find a number of drop-down menus that can be used to navigate the IDE, perform tasks or open additional windows with tools to help you craft your games. Note that we list here the _default_ menus that are available, but some of the asset editors will add additional menus depending on context. These additional menus are explained on the pages relevant to the editor that created them.

The default menus available are:

-   [The File Menu](Menus/The_File_Menu.md)
-   [The Edit Menu](Menus/The_Edit_Menu.md)
-   [The Build Menu](Menus/The_Build_Menu.md)
-   [The Windows Menu](Menus/The_Windows_Menu.md)
-   [The Tools Menu](Menus/The_Tools_Menu.md)
-   [The Marketplace Menu](Menus/The_Marketplace_Menu.md)
-   [The Layouts Menu](Menus/The_Layouts_Menu.md)
-   [The Help Menu](Menus/The_Help_Menu.md)
-   [Version & Account Details](Menus/Version_&_Account_Details.md)
