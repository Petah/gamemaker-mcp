# GameMaker IDE

GameMaker's **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (or IDE) is the main interface where you create your games and make use of all functionality provided by the software. Essentially, the program itself -- from the Start Screen to every editor window you use to make your game -- is known and referred to as the **IDE** throughout the manual and various tutorials.
