# camera\_set\_view\_mat

This function will set the **view matrix** for a given camera. You give the unique camera ID value (as returned by the different [camera\_create()](camera_create.md) functions) and a view matrix to be applied. You can find out more about creating view matrices from the section [Matrix Functions](../../Maths_And_Numbers/Matrix_Functions/Matrix_Functions.md), specifically [matrix\_build\_lookat()](../../Maths_And_Numbers/Matrix_Functions/matrix_build_lookat.md).

Note that if your camera does automatic object tracking - ie: it has been created using [camera\_create\_view()](camera_create_view.md)Â with an object index / instance ID that isn't -1, or you are setting a camera defined in the Room Editor, or you are setting the default camera - then this matrix will get overwritten the next game frame.

#### Syntax:

camera\_set\_view\_mat(camera\_id, matrix)

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| camera_id | Camera ID | The unique camera ID value returned when you created the camera. |
| matrix | Matrix | The unique matrix ID returned when you created the matrix. |

#### Returns:

N/A

#### Example:

view\_camera\[0\] = camera\_create();
var viewmat = matrix\_build\_lookat(640, 240, -10, 640, 240, 0, 0, 1, 0);
var projmat = matrix\_build\_projection\_ortho(640, 480, 1.0, 32000.0);
camera\_set\_view\_mat(view\_camera\[0\], viewmat);
camera\_set\_proj\_mat(view\_camera\[0\], projmat);

The above code creates a new camera and assigns it to view port\[0\]. This camera then has its view and projection matrices set.
