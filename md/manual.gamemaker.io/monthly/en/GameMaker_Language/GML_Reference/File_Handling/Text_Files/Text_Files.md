# Text Files

Text files are a useful way to store large amounts of data externally from your game. Contrary to ini files, you can have up to 32 text files open at once, and you can read and write large chunks of data to them as well. However, it is up to you to decide how that data should be structured as there is no set "section" or "key" structure like with [\*.ini files](../Ini_Files/Ini_Files.md).

The following functions exist that deal with files:

-   [file\_text\_open\_read](file_text_open_read.md)
-   [file\_text\_open\_write](file_text_open_write.md)
-   [file\_text\_open\_append](file_text_open_append.md)
-   [file\_text\_open\_from\_string](file_text_open_from_string.md)
-   [file\_text\_read\_real](file_text_read_real.md)
-   [file\_text\_read\_string](file_text_read_string.md)
-   [file\_text\_readln](file_text_readln.md)
-   [file\_text\_write\_real](file_text_write_real.md)
-   [file\_text\_write\_string](file_text_write_string.md)
-   [file\_text\_writeln](file_text_writeln.md)
-   [file\_text\_eoln](file_text_eoln.md)
-   [file\_text\_eof](file_text_eof.md)
-   [file\_text\_close](file_text_close.md)
