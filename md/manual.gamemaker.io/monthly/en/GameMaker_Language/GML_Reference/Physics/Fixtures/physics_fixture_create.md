# physics\_fixture\_create

The first step in setting up a fixture is creating it with this function. The returning index should be stored in a variable to be used in all further functions that are used to define and use this fixture.

NOTEÂ You can only define a fixture within a room that has [Physics](../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Room_Properties/Room_Properties.htm#physics) enabled.

#### Syntax:

physics\_fixture\_create()

#### Returns:

[Physics Fixture ID](physics_fixture_create.md)

#### Example:

fix\_Ball = physics\_fixture\_create();

The code above will create a fixture and store its index in the variable "fix\_Ball".
