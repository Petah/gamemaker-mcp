# Steam

All Steam functions in GameMaker have been moved out of the base runner and are now part of an extension, [which can be found here](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-Steamworks).

For information on the Steam extension functions, please refer to the manual provided with the extension package, or the [wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-Steamworks/wiki).
