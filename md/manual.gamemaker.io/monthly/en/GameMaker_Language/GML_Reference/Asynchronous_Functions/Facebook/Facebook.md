# Facebook

Facebook is one of the most important social media sites on the internet and many games and developers currently have their own pages for posting games and media. GameMaker has an extension that permits you to connect with Facebook and perform certain actions and tasks that their API permits. It is recommended that you visit the [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) page before starting to use the extension as a firm understanding of how the Facebook Graph works and the available calls and permissions is essential for you to get the most from these functions.

You can find out how to setup and use the Facebook extension for all available platforms from the following link:

-   [Android, iOS and HTML5: Integrating Facebook](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004488072-iOS-Android-and-HTML5-Integrating-Facebook)

The following areÂ **obsolete functions** that were only valid for the legacy Facebook API. As such you **can no longer use these functions** in your projects and they are listed here in case you have imported an old project with them in it. For current Facebook functionality you need to have activated the **Facebook API** in the appropriate [Game Options](../../../../Settings/Game_Options.md) for the target platform, which will prompt you to download and install an extension. The extension comes with a \*.pdf format "mini-manual" explaining how to use it as well as showing all the function definitions and examples. All references to the old facebook\_\*() functions will need to be replaced (and updated) to use the extension fb\_\*() equivalents.
