# Sprite Elements

The GameMaker [Room Editor](../../../../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.md) permits you to add [Sprites](../../Sprites/Sprites.md) into any given room using _layers_. As the name implies, a layer is simply a collection of assets that are all considered to be at the same depth within the room, and by stacking layers you can make some things draw over or under others. You can also control certain aspects of layers from code, adding or removing things, or changing certain properties of the layer or what it contains at run time. This page lists all the functions that can be used for editing **sprite elements** that have been added to an [**asset layer**](../../../../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Room_Properties/Layer_Properties.md).

The functions given below for modifying Sprite Elements can also be used on Sprite Elements contained within UI layers, accessible through the [Flex Panel Struct](../../../Flex_Panels/Flex_Panels_Styling.md).
