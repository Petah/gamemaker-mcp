# Paths

GameMaker has an extensive collection of functions and built-in variables for using paths within your game. This section deals with the basic ones that are used when dealing with paths that have previously been created in [The Path Editor](../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Paths.md), but further functions exist that permit you to create your own paths using code, and to manipulate them in various ways.
