# path\_position

This built-in variable can be used to get or to set the position of an instance along a path. The value is normalised from 0 - 1, so if you set it to, for example, 0.5, the instance will be moved to exactly the middle of the path.

#### Syntax:

path\_position

#### Returns:

[Real](../../../../GML_Overview/Data_Types.md)

#### Example:

path\_positionÂ = random(1);

The above code sets the instance to a random position anywhere on the current path.
