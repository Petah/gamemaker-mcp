# draw\_self

This function draws the sprite assigned to the instance exactly as it would be drawn if the Draw event held no code or actions, and will reflect and changes that have been made to the [Sprite Instance Variables](../../Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/Sprite_Instance_Variables.md) in other events.

NOTE This function performs the [default draw](../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Draw_Events.htm#default_draw).

#### Syntax:

draw\_self();

#### Returns:

N/A

#### Example:

draw\_self();

This makes the instance draw itself with the properties defined by the built-in sprite variables.
