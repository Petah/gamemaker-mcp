# gpu\_set\_stencil\_fail

This function sets the stencil operation to perform when the stencil test fails.

The default operation when the stencil test fails is stencilop\_keep. You can set it to one of the following:

| Constant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| stencilop_keep | Keeps the current value in the stencil buffer. |
| stencilop_zero | Sets the stencil buffer value to 0. |
| stencilop_replace | Replaces the value in the buffer to the new stencil reference value. |
| stencilop_incr | Increments the stencil buffer value, clamping at the maximum value. |
| stencilop_incr_wrap | Increments the stencil buffer value, wrapping to 0 at the maximum value. |
| stencilop_decr | Decrements the stencil buffer value, clamping at 0. |
| stencilop_decr_wrap | Decrements the stencil buffer value, wrapping to the maximum value at 0. |
| stencilop_invert | Performs a bitwise inversion on the current stencil buffer value. |

#### Syntax:

gpu\_set\_stencil\_fail(stencil\_op);

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stencil_op | Stencil Op Constant | A constant indicating the stencil operation to perform on pixels for which the stencil test fails. |

#### Returns:

N/A

#### Example:

gpu\_set\_stencil\_fail(stencilop\_replace);

The above code sets the stencil operation to replace for pixels that fail the stencil test. This operation replaces the current value in the stencil buffer with the currently set stencil reference value (set earlier withÂ [gpu\_set\_stencil\_ref](gpu_set_stencil_ref.md)).
