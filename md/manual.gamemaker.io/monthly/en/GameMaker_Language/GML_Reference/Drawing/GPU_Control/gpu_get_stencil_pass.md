# gpu\_get\_stencil\_pass

This function gets the operation that's performed on pixels for which the stencil test passes.

The default operation performed when the stencil test passes is stencilop\_keep.

#### Syntax:

gpu\_get\_stencil\_pass()

#### Returns:

[Stencil Op Constant](../Depth_And_Stencil_Buffer/The_Depth_And_Stencil_Buffer.htm#stencil_op_constant)

#### Example:

var \_pass\_op =Â gpu\_get\_stencil\_pass();

The above code gets the stencil operation that's used when the stencil test passes and stores it in a local variable \_pass\_op for further use.
