# draw\_primitive\_end

This function must be called when you have finished defining the points of your primitive. If you do not call this function, _nothing will be drawn_ as this effectively tells GameMaker that you have finished and that it can now draw the defined primitive.

#### Syntax:

draw\_primitive\_end();

#### Returns:

N/A

#### Example:

draw\_set\_colour(c\_white);
var \_tex = sprite\_get\_texture(spr\_Background, 0);
draw\_primitive\_begin\_texture(pr\_trianglestrip, \_tex);
draw\_vertex\_texture(0, 0, 0, 0);
draw\_vertex\_texture(640, 0, 1, 0);
draw\_vertex\_texture(0, 480, 0, 1);
draw\_vertex\_texture(640, 480, 1, 1);
draw\_primitive\_end();

The above code will draw a 4 vertex triangle strip textured with the texture held in the \_texÂ variable.
