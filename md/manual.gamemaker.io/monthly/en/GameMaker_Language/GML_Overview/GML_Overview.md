# GML Code Overview

This section of the manual contains all the information required to understand and use GML Code. The runtime functions in this language can be used to create your games and is added into objects from [The Object Editor](../../The_Asset_Editors/Objects.md), although it can also be used along with [GML Visual](../../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index.md). Below you can see a typical image of an object with the code editor open on an event:

![Object, Events and Code Overview](../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/GML/Overview/Code_Overview_Main.png)Each event has its own tab in the editor and you can add, edit, or remove code from them at any time (for more information on events see [Object Events](../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Object_Events.md)). The code itself must have a basic structure and can contain resource indices, variables, functions, expressions, keywords, etc. all of which are explained in the sections below. If you are a novice to programming or making the switch from [GML Visual](../../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index.md), it is recommended that you start with the page on [Basic Code Structure](Basic_Code_Structure.md) and then read through all the other pages in this section, testing code from each one within GameMaker itself.

You can use [Feather](../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Feather_Settings.md) for intelligent code completion and error reporting in your GML Code scripts.
