# GML Code

The GameMaker Language (also called simply GML) is the proprietary GameMaker **scripting language**. This language is structured to permit users to create their games in an intuitive and flexible way while offering all the power of any other major programming language. It is also the basis for [GML Visual](../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index.md) and can be used in conjunction with that if required.

The GML Code section of the manual is split into the following sections:

-   [Overview](GML_Overview/GML_Overview.md)
-   [Reference](GML_Reference/GML_Reference.md)
