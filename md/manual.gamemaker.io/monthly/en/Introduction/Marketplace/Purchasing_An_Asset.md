# Getting An Asset

To get an asset from the Marketplace you must first be logged in to your [GameMaker Account](../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Licencing_Information.md). Once you have created your account and logged into Marketplace, you can then browse the asset packages available. You can download [official extensions](https://marketplace.gamemaker.io/publishers/23/yoyo-games) or content created by other community members, and currently only the content that is free can be acquired.

If you are getting an asset package for GameMaker then you simply have to select it from the market listings and click the "**Add to Account**" button. This will add the asset to your library and then you will be able to download it.
