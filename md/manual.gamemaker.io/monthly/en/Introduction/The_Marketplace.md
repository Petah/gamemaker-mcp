# The Marketplace

![The GameMaker Marketplace](../assets/Images/Introduction/Tools_MarketplaceWindow.png)The **Marketplace** is GameMaker'sÂ online market for downloading and sharing free asset packages. An asset package can be just about anything related to GameMaker, i.e.: sprites, scripts, shaders, or even full game engines or frameworks. To be able to create, download and share packages, you must first be registered on the Marketplace as a publisher and have signed in through GameMaker (this will be automatic when you log into the program) or from the main [Marketplace webpage](https://marketplace.gamemaker.io/). You can find more information on becoming a publisher from the pages linked at the bottom of this page.

On the Marketplace you can access your user account (and it's linked publisher accounts) from the top right of the page, and you can also browse and download asset packages for use. You can find full information on how to download an asset package from the pages linked at the bottom of this page.

The following pages go into the process of creating a publisher account, listing an asset or a service, and then creating and uploading the asset package, as well as a few other important details:
