# Template Info

This section allows you to set information for your project which is used when it's [exported as a template](../../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_File_Menu.htm#export).

![](../../assets/Images/Settings/Game_Options/Template_Info.png)Here you can assign an image, icon and description for the template project, however this will only be used when it's actually exported as a template. You can do that by opening the [File Menu](../../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_File_Menu.md), hovering on "Export Project" and selecting "As Template".

Any templates you create will be tied to the account you are logged in with. If you later log in through a different account, you won't be able to access the same custom templates.
