# GameMaker Runner Settings

The following sections are all related to the different GameMaker windows and tools that will affect how your game is run and performs. In general, you will need to set up most of these on a per-game basis, but note that some are optional and not required (like **Configurations**), while the availability of others will depend on the licence that you have (like some of the **Game Options**).
