# ![Assign Variable Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Time_Sources/Action_Icons/BPM_to_Seconds.png)Â BPM to Seconds

This action takes a beats-per-minute value, and returns the length of each beat in seconds.

This can be used when [creating a Time Source](Create_Time_Source.md) to use a BPM value for the Time Source. It's important that such a Time Source uses **seconds** as its [unit](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Time_Sources/Time_Source_Units.md).
