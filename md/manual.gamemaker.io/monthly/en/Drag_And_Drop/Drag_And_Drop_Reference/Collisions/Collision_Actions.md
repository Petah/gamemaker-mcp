When planning motions or deciding on certain actions, it is often important to see whether there are collisions with other objects at certain places within the game world, and often choosing the right collision for the job is the most important task of all. GameMaker has a number of actions to help you deal with collisions correctly and in accordance with the needs of your project:

|  | If Any Object At Place |
| --- | --- |
|  | If Object At Place |
|  | If Collision Shape |
|  | If Collision Point |
