# ![Pause Audio Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Audio/i_Audio_Pause_Audio.png)Â Pause Audio

This action can be used to pause the chosen sound if it is currently playing. Note if you have played multiple instances of the same sound, _all_ of them will be paused, and this does not pause any sounds played _after_ the action has been called. You can start a paused sound playing again using the action [Resume Audio](Resume_Audio.md).
