# ![If Audio Is Playing Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Audio/i_Audio_If_Audio_Is_Playing.png)Â If Audio Is Playing

This action can be used to check whether an instance of any sound resource is currently playing in your game. You give the sound resource to check for from the asset explorer and the function will return true if it is playing and false if it is not, although if you check the "not" flag, this is reversed and the function will return true if the sound is _not_ playing and false otherwise.

Note that to add actions into the "if" block, they should be dropped to the side of the action, as shown in the image below:
