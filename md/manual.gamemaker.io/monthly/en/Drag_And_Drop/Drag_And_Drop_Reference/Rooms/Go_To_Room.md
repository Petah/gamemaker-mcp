# ![Go To Room Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Rooms/i_Rooms_Go_To_Room.png)Â Go To Room

This action will end the current room and go to the room specified by the input index. The room must exist or else an error will be given, and if you use the same room as the current room it will have the same effect as using [Restart Room](Restart_Room.md). Note that the room will _not_ change until the end of the event or script where the action was called, so any actions after this one will still run.

#### Action Syntax:

#### Arguments:

| Argument | Description |
