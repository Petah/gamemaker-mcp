# ![If Room Is Last Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Rooms/i_Rooms_If_Room_Is_Last.png)Â If Room Is Last

This action will check to see if the current room is the last room as listed in the [Room Manager](../../../Settings/The_Room_Manager.md). The action will return true if the current room is the last in the Room Manager and false if it is not. You can flag the _not_ checkbox to turn this into "If Room Is NOT Last".

Note that to add actions into the "if" block, they should be dropped to the side of the action, as shown in the image below:

![Room Is Last drop actions](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Rooms/Room_Is_Last_Drop.png)These actions will now be run if the "if" evaluates to true, while any actions dropped elsewhere will be performed after the "if" block.

If it is not then the game will go to the next room in the Asset Browser, otherwise it will go to a specific room.
