# ![Go To Previous Room Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Rooms/i_Rooms_Go_To_Previous_Room.png)Â Go To Previous Room

This action will make your game go to the previous room as listed in the [Room Manager](../../../Settings/The_Room_Manager.md) at the time the game was compiled. If this room does not exist, an error will be thrown and the game will be forced to close. Note that the room will not change until the end of the event or script where the action was called, so any code after this action will still run.
