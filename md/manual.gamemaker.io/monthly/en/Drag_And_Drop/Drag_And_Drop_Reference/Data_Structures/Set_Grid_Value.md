# ![Set Grid Value Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Data_Structures/i_DS_Set_Grid_Value.png)Â Set Grid Value

With this action you can set a specific cell within the grid data structure to a value. You supply the variable that holds the grid index (as returned by the action [Create Grid](Create_Grid.md)) and then give the x and y position (the column and row) for the cell to set, and then finally the value for that cell. The value can be any valid data type, but the x and y position must be whole integers within the bounds of the grid.

#### Action Syntax:

![Set Grid Value Action](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Data_Structures/a_DS_Set_Grid_Value.png)

#### Arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Grid | The index (stored in a variable) of the grid to set |
| x | The cell position along the x axis to set (the column) |
| y | The cell position along the y axis to set (the row) |
| Value | The value to set the grid cell to |

#### Example:

![Set Grid Value Example](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Data_Structures/e_DS_Set_Grid_Value.png)The above action block code creates a new grid data structure and holds its index value in a global variable. It then iterates through all the instances in the room and adds their unique ID value into the cell that corresponds to their position.
