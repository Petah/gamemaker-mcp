# ![If Data Structure Exists Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Data_Structures/i_DS_If_Data_Structure_Exists.png)Â If Data Structure Exists

With this action you can check a variable to see if it indexes a data structure or not . You first need to pick the type of data structure to check for (either a List, a Map, a Grid or a Stack) and then you supply the variable that holds the data structure index (as returned by the actions [Create List](Create_List.md), [Create Map](Create_Map.md), [Create Grid](Create_Grid.md), and [Create Stack](Create_Stack.md)). The action will return true if the data structure exists, and false if it does not. Note that you can flag "not" in the action to check if a variable does _not_ hold a data structure index.

Note that to add actions into the "if" block, they should be dropped to the side of the action, as shown in the image below:

![If DS Exists drop actions](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Data_Structures/If_Exists_Drop.png)These actions will now be run if the "if" evaluates to true, while any actions dropped elsewhere will be performed after the "if" block.
