# ![Get Buffer Size Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Buffers/i_Buffers_Get_Buffer_Size.png)Â Get Buffer Size

This action can be used to retrieve the size of a buffer, in bytes. You supply the unique buffer ID value as returned by the action [Create Buffer](Create_Buffer.md) and then give a target variable to return the size value to. The target variable can be flagged as being a temporary local variable, in which case it will be created for you and removed from memory again at the end of the current action script or event.

#### Action Syntax:
