# Camera Action Library

![Camera Action Library](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Cameras/Lib_Camera.png)The **Cameras** library has actions that relate to setting the different variables associated with the camera view. A camera is a point in the room from which the room is viewed, and the camera view is _what_ the camera sees (and what is drawn to the screen). These actions permit you to manipulate the different parts of the camera view and define areas of the room to show through the view position or view size as well as a few other basic functions.

The following actions are available:

|  | Set View Variable |
| --- | --- |
|  | Get View Variable |
