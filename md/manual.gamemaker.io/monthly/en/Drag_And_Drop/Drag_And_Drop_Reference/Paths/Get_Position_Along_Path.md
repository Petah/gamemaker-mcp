# ![Get Position Along Path Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Paths/i_Paths_Get_Position_Along_Path.png)Â Get Position Along Path

This action will get the position of an instance along a path. The returned value is normalised from 0 - 1, so if you get a result of, for example, 0.5, the instance exactly in the middle of the path. Note that you must have called the [Start Following Path](Start_Following_Path.md) action to assign a path to the instance for this action to return a value other than 0. The returned value will be stored in the target variable you give, or you can flag the variable as a temporary local variable to create it and assign the value.
