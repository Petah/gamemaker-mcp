# ![Set Position Along Path Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Paths/i_Paths_Set_Position_Along_Path.png)Â Set Position Along Path

This action will set the position of an instance along a path. The value is normalised from 0 - 1, so if you set it to, for example, 0.5, the instance will be moved to exactly the middle of the path. Note that you must have called the [Start Following Path](Start_Following_Path.md) action to assign a path to the instance for this to have any effect.

#### Action Syntax:

![Path Position Action](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Paths/a_Paths_Set_Position_Along_Path.png)

#### Arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Position | The position (from 0 - 1) along the path to place the instance |

#### Example:

![Path Position Example](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Paths/e_Paths_Set_Position_Along_Path.png)The above action block code starts the instance along a path and then generates a random decimal value between 0 and 1. This value is stored in a temporary local variable and used to set the position of the instance along the path.
