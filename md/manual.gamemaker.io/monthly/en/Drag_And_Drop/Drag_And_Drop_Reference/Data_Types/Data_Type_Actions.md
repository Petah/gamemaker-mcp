![Data Types Action Library](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Data_Types/lib_Type.png)GameMaker has a number of different data types, like integers, strings, pointers, etc... and some of those can be converted to others. This section of the manual shows the different actions available for dealing with and converting different data types.
