# ![Gamepad Get Connected Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Gamepad/i_GamePad_Get_Connected.png)Â Get Gamepad Connected

You can use this action to check and see if a given gamepad "slot" has a gamepad connected. You supply the gamepad index (this is the number of "slot" that a gamepad occupies) and the returned value will be stored in the target variable that you supply for future use (this can be flagged as a temporary local variable that you create for this event or script).

#### Action Syntax:

#### Arguments:

| Argument | Description |

#### Example:

![Gamepad Get Connected Example](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Gamepad/e_GamePad_Get_Connected.png)The above action block code runs a for loop to check and see if a gamepad is connected to any of the 12 available "slots". If a gamepad is discovered, a global variable is set to the current slot number and the loop is broken.
