# Movement Action Library

![Movement Actions Library](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Movement/Lib_Movement.png)

In any game, movement and position are of paramount importance and so GameMaker has a complete selection of actions to deal with every situation. The two main ways of moving an instance is to either set the actual position (x/y) within the room, or to set a speed/direction vector. The actions shown here cover both methods and you can use the **Common** Action [Assign Variable](../Common/Assign_Variable.md) to directly set the x and y position yourself.

The **Movement** actions available are as follows:

-   [Set Direction Fixed](Set_Direction_Fixed.md)
-   [Set Direction Variable](Set_Direction_Variable.md)
-   [Set Point Direction](Set_Point_Direction.md)
-   [Set Direction Random](Set_Direction_Random.md)

-   [Set Gravity Direction](Set_Gravity_Direction.md)
-   [Set Gravity Force](Set_Gravity_Force.md)
