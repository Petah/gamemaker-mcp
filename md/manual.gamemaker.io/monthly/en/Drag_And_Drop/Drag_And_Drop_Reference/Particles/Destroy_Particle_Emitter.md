# ![Destroy Particle Emitter Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Particles/i_Particles_Destroy_Particle_Emitter.png)Â Destroy Particle Emitter

This action will "destroy" the given particle emitter, ie: free up the memory used by the particle emitter. You supply the particle system ID that the emitter belongs to (as returned by the action [Create Particle System](Create_Particle_System.md)) and then the actual emitter ID (as returned by the action [Create Particle Emitter](Create_Particle_Emitter.md)). This action should be called whenever you no longer need a particle emitter in your game, or whenever you wish to re-create the particle emitter (for example, just before calling a [Game Restart](../Game/Restart_Game.md)). Note that if the particle system the emitter has been assigned to has _not_ been flagged as **Persistent** then you do _not need to call this action_, as the emitter will be automatically cleaned up on room end along with the particle system.
