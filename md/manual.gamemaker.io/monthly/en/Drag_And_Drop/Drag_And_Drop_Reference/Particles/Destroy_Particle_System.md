# ![Destroy Particle System Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Particles/i_Particles_Destroy_Particle_System.png)Â Destroy Particle System

This action will "destroy" the given particle system (ie: free up the memory used by the particle system). You supply the unique ID value for the system to destroy, as returned when you created the system with the action [Create Particle System](Create_Particle_System.md). This action should be called whenever you no longer need a particle system in your game, or whenever you wish to re-create the particle system (for example, just before calling a [Restart Game](../Game/Restart_Game.md)). Note that if the particle system has _not_ been flagged as **Persistent** then you do not need to call this action, as the particle system (and any emitters associated with it) will be automatically cleaned up on room end.

**IMPORTANT!** This function will also destroy and remove any emitters that may have been created and associated with the system being destroyed (see [Create Particle Emitter](Create_Particle_Emitter.md) for more information).
