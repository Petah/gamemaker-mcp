# Instance Variable Action Library

![Instance Variable Action Library](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Instance_Vars/Lib_Instance_Variables.png)

The **Instance Variables** actions are designed to get you started when creating a game and are used to create and maintain specific instance scope variables for score, lives and health (you can find out more about variable scope [here](../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Variables_And_Variable_Scope.md)). These actions will create these variables for you at any time they are used and are meant more for convenience or for beginners, and if you need more complex control over game values you should be making your own variables using the appropriate actions (see [here](../Common/Common_Actions_Library.md))

The following actions exist for using these **Instance Variables**:

|  | Set Score |
| --- | --- |
|  | Get Score |
|  | Set Lives |
|  | Get Lives |
|  | Set Health |
|  | Get Health |
|  | If Score |
|  | If Lives |
|  | If Health |
