# ![Set Lives Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Instance_Vars/i_IV_Set_Lives.png)Â Set Lives

With this action you can create or set an instance variable for lives. You supply the value to either set the lives variable to or to add to the lives variable (if you tick the _relative_ checkbox then the value will be added to the current "lives" value). Note that unlike regular instance variables the variable name for "lives" is stored internally so to retrieve the score value you need to use the action [Get Lives](Get_Lives.md).

#### Action Syntax:
