# Loop ActionÂ Library

![Loop Action Library](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Loops/Lib_Loops.png)The **Loop** action library contains those actions that are required for creating loops in your game action code. A loop is simply a way of iterating over the same set of actions 1 or more times depending on certain conditions and are handy in any situation where you need to repeat the same actions over and over again.

The **Loop** library has the following actions:

|  | Loop |
| --- | --- |
|  | Repeat |
|  | While Loop |
|  | For Loop |
|  | Break |
