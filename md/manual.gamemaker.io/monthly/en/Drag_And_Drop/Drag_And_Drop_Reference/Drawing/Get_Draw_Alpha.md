# ![Get Draw Alpha Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Drawing/i_Drawing_Get_Draw_Alpha.png)Â Get Draw Alpha

With this action you can get the general alpha being used drawing. The action will return the current alpha to the **target variable** that you specify, which can have been created previously or can be a new temporary one (if you check the "Temp" check-box).

#### Action Syntax:
