# ![Set Instance Timeline Icon](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Timelines/i_Timelines_Set_Instance_Timeline.png)Â Set Instance Timeline

This action assigns a timeline from the Asset Browser to the instance. You give the timeline to assign , and then you can choose to have the timeline loop when it reaches the last moment (the next frame after the last moment is run will loop back to the first moment of the timeline again) as well as whether to start the timeline immediately or not. If you do not start the timeline immediately you can use the action [Set Timeline State](Set_Timeline_State.md) to start it later in another event or script.
