# Timeline Action Library

![Timeline Action Library](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Timelines/Lib_Timelines.png)**Timelines** are a powerful mechanism for controlling events in your game, and are based on "moments", where a "moment" is simply a single game step. These timelines are generally created from the Asset Browser in a similar way to an object, ie: you create a timeline in the [Timeline Editor](../../../The_Asset_Editors/Timelines.md), then in each moment that you require it to perform an action you add some code or a GML Visual action for it to perform.

Once a timeline resource has been created, you can then stop, start, and manipulate it through the following actions:

|  | Set Instance Timeline |
| --- | --- |
|  | Set Timeline Moment |
|  | Set Timeline Speed |
|  | Set Timeline State |
