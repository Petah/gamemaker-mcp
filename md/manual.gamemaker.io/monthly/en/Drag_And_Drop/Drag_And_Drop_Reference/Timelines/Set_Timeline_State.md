This action can be used to start, stop, pause or resume a timeline. The timeline must first have been set for the instance using the action [Set Instance Timeline](Set_Instance_Timeline.md), and then you can use this action at any time to change its running state from the following options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Start | Start the timeline assigned to the instance (if the timeline was paused this will set the start position to moment 0 again). |
| Resume | Resume a paused timeline (if the timeline was stopped and not paused this will do nothing). |
| Paused | Pause the timeline assigned to the instance (while paused the moments in a timeline will not advance with the game frames). |
| Stop | Stop the timeline assigned to the instance. |
