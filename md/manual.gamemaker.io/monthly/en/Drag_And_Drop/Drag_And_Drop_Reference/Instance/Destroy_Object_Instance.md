# ![Destroy Object Instance Action](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Instance/i_Instance_Destroy.png)Â Destroy Instance

You can call this action whenever you wish to "destroy" an instance, which will remove it from the room. You should note that when you destroy an instance, its [Destroy Event](../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Object_Events.md) is called _immediately after the action that calls the destroy_. Also note that although the Destroy Event is performed the instant that the action is called, the instance is _not_ immediately removed from the game, and it will continue to perform the code contained in the current event until the end, and only when the current event is over will the instance be removed from the game, at which time the [Clean Up Event](../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Object_Events.md) will be called.

#### Action Syntax:

#### Example:

![Destroy Object Instance Example](../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Instance/e_Instance_Destroy.png)The above action block code checks for a collision with any other instance at the position of the calling instance, and if one is found, it destroys itself.
