# GML Visual

GML Visual is the **visual scripting** method for programming with the [GameMaker Language](../GameMaker_Language/GameMaker_Language_Index.md) (GML). It consists of using **action blocks** to construct game logic in a visual and intuitive way, and is an ideal tool for people who are learning programming, or for people that have a more visual inclination.

The GML Visual section of the manual is split into the following sections:

-   [Overview](Drag_And_Drop_Overview/DnD_Overview.md)
-   [Reference](Drag_And_Drop_Reference/DnD_Reference.md)
