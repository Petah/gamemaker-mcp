# Summary

We're at the end of this Quick Start Guide and we hope you've gained enough knowledge and confidence to go and start using GameMaker to make your own projects! if you've gone through all the pages of this guide, then you should now know the following:

-   How to create **Sprites** and **Tile Sets** and edit them in the **Image Editor**
-   How to create **Objects** and **Rooms**
-   The difference between an **object** and an **instance**
-   How GameMaker draws things and how to use the **Draw Event**
-   The difference between the **Draw** event and the **Draw GUI** event
-   How to move instances about in a **room**
-   Basic programming concepts like **variables**, **functions** and **expressions**

You've come a long way in a short time, but that's not the end of the journey. This manual has two extensive reference sections that cover every aspect of the IDE and how to program using either GML Visual or GML Code, and we highly recommend that you come back here to those sections whenever you are unsure of something or want to try something new:

-   [GameMaker IDE](../The_IDE/The_IDE.md)
-   [GML Visual​​​​​​​ Reference](../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Reference/DnD_Reference.md)
-   [GML Code Reference](../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/GML_Reference.md)
-   [Additional Information](../Additional_Information/Additional_Information.md)

You can also get a number of GameMaker tutorials from the [Start Page](../Introduction/The_Start_Page.md) which use the core concepts you've learned here to make small and fun games, like [Space Rocks](https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/make-arcade-space-shooter).

For further technical help with things like setting up the different target platforms you should see the [GameMaker Helpdesk](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/categories/204246668-GameMaker-Studio-2), and GameMaker also run a series of [Tech Blogs](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/category/tech) which cover all sorts of different aspects of using GameMaker, from the most basic concepts to the most advanced techniques so there's something there for everybody. In particular, have a look at the following article:

-   [Six Resources That Taught The Pros How to Code with GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/useful-resources-when-learning-to-code-with-gml)

We would also like to point out that GameMaker has its own forums called the [GMC](https://forum.gamemaker.io/index.php) (**G**ame **M**aker **C**ommunity) which are community run and full of helpful members that are willing to give some of their time to help with any programming or technical issues that you may have.

For issues within the GameMaker IDE or runner, or feature requests, you can file bug reports to us through the [Help menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu.md) -> **Report A GameMaker Bug**.

Finally, there are a huge amount of GameMaker resources around the internet, so always try searching for information in your browser when stuck or looking for tutorials, and there are also number of active communities on sites like **Reddit** or **Discord** where you can sign up and participate.

Whatever you do, we hope that you have fun using GameMaker, and if (when!) you do make a game and publish it, don't forget to drop us a line to tell us about it for the [GameMaker Showcase](https://gamemaker.io/en/showcase)!

**Happy GameMaking!**
