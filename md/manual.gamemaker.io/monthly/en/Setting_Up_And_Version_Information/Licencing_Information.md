# Licencing Information

You can start and use GameMaker without making an account. You will be asked to create an account when you [create an executable](../Introduction/Compiling.md).

Use the [Version & Account Details](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/Version_&_Account_Details.md) menu to sign in before creating executables. You can use an **Opera account** to sign in, or use a **Legacy YoYo Account**.

## Licencing Information

For information on the various GameMaker licences and obtaining them, see the links on [Licencing & Version Information](GMS2_Version_Information.md).

**IMPORTANT** After purchasing any new licence for GameMaker, use the **Update License** option in the [Version & Account Details](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/Version_&_Account_Details.md) menu so your new licence details are loaded.

## Legacy Sign In & Proxy

You can use a Legacy YoYo Account to sign into GameMaker. This will open the following window:

![GameMaker Proxy Window](../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Getting_Started_Proxy.png)You can now add in your proxy details. Some of the fields shown above are optional and if there is one you don't require then simply leave the field blank. Before continuing however it is worth noting that if you have set a proxy in your [Windows Internet Options](https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/4-ways-to-open-internet-options-in-windows-10.html), and it doesn't require a username/password, then it should just "as is" and you probably will not be required to set up the proxy in GameMaker.

If your proxy does require a username and/or password, then you'll need to add them in to the fields shown in the window above. Note that in these cases the username/password/proxy details will always be required, and that the proxy IP should also have the port added, ie: xx.xx.xx.xx:port.

Once you have added the relevant information, click on OK and log in to GameMaker.
