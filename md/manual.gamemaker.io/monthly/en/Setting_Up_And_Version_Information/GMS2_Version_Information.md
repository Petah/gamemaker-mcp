# Licencing & Version Information

There are various versions of the licences that you can get for GameMaker, the choice of which will depend largely on the audience that you want to target as well as on whether you just want to have some fun making games or wish to sell and distribute them as well.

For up-to-date information on GameMakerÂ licences, please see the following pages:

-   [GameMaker Free Version](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/230492887-GameMaker-Free-Version)
-   [Upgrading GameMaker Licences](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/235409387-How-To-Upgrade-Your-GameMaker-Licence)

Regardless of the version of GameMaker that you use, they will all require same basic setup before use. The sections listed below all deal with this, and include information on updating the IDE and Runtimes, the required SDKs for specific target modules, and the IDE Preferences to adapt how GameMaker works to suit your own style of doing things.
