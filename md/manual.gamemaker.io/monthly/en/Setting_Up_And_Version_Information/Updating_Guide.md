# Updating Guide

The GameMaker IDE will check for updates on start-up and prompt you to download the latest available update:

![New Version Window](../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Getting_Started_New_Version.png)

You can also open this window manually using [The Help Menu](../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu.md).

This gives you the option of downloading the update, skipping it to be reminded the next time the IDE is started and skipping the automatic update prompt until a newer release. You can also open the Release Notes for the update to read about the changes.

Updates are mostly optional however some releases may require you to update before using GameMaker. Even when optional, we strongly recommend updating to new available versions as they will always contain stability improvements and bug fixes, and major releases may bring new features. However you may choose to not install them if you don't wish to or think that some of the changes may break a project that you are about to publish.

GameMaker is more than just an IDE and has a number of different runtime tools that it uses behind the scenes to build your games for the different target platforms available. These tools are mainly the different runners and compilers that each platform requires, and you can actually have several of each at any one time. What this means is that you can "pick and choose" which runner version to use should you have found any issues with the current one or are aiming at a very specific target version or platform. These tools will automatically update when there is a new version available, but you can then use the [Runtime Feeds Preferences](IDE_Preferences/Runtime_Feed_Preferences.md) to select which ones you actually want to use.

After an IDE update has been installed, you will get the [Runtime Modules Dialog](Installation_Guide.htm#h) which allows you to select the runtime modules to install.
