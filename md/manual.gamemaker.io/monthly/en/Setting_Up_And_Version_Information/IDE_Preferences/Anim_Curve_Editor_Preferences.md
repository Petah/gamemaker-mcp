# Animation Curve Editor Preferences

![The Animation Curve Preferences](../../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/AnimCurve_Prefs.png)

The **Animation Curves Preferences** are used to define certain properties for when you are working with the [Animation Curve Editor](../../The_Asset_Editors/Animation_Curves.md). The options available are:

-   **Automatic response to curve deletion**: This option can be used to control the pop up message that is shown when you delete a curve from the Animation Curve editor. The default action here is to show a warning message, but you can set this to "Okay" and the dialog will not be shown.
