# Extension Editor Preferences

![The Extension Editor Preferences](../../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/ExtensionEditor_Prefs.png)The **Extension Editor preferences** cover a few options related to the messages that you are shown when using it, with the exact details outlined below:

-   **Automatic response to file deletion**: The default setting here is to show a message asking if you are sure you want to delete, but you can set this to "OK" so that all deletions are completed without this message as if you'd clicked okay already.
-   **Automatic response to proxy file deletion**: As above, this controls the message you are shown on deletion of any proxy files.
