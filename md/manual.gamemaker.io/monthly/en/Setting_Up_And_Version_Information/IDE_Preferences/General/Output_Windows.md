# Output Window Preferences

![Output Window Prefs](../../../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/General_OutputWindow_Prefs.png)

The [**Output Window**](../../../Introduction/The_Output_Window.md) preferences control the different colour and formatting options for the various different output windows in the IDE. Each of the different windows has the same set of options, which are listed below:

-   **Colour**: The default colour for the text being written to the window.
-   **Font Name**: The name of the font to use (available fonts will depend on those installed on your system).
-   **Style**: The font style to use, like **bold** or _italics_ (note that not all windows will permit the same styles and it will also depend on the font used).
-   **Size**: The size to set the font to for the given output window.
-   **Anti-Aliasing**: Here you can set the anti-aliasing mode for the output windows font rendering. You can choose to let the IDE decide by selecting _Use Default_, or you can force it _On_ or _Off_ by selecting either of those options.
