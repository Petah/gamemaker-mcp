# Power Saving Preferences

![Power Saving Prefs](../../../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/General_Power_Prefs.png)

The **Power Saving** preferences here will affect how much CPU power and GPU power will be used to generate the GameMaker IDE (essentially this will lower the base framerate at which the program runs and so lower power consumption).

The options here are:

-   **AC power framerate (%)**: The base IDE framerate modifier when connected to a power input. Default is 100%.
-   **Battery power framerate (%)**: The base IDE framerate modifier when using battery to power the machine. Default is 35%.
-   **Background framerate (%)**: The base IDE framerate modifier when GameMaker is not in focus (regardless of the power supply). Default is 15%.
