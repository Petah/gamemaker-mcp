# Recent Windows Preferences

![Recent Wndows Prefs](../../../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/General_Recent_Windows_Prefs.png)

The preferences here contain options for how the [Recent Windows](../../../IDE_Navigation/Recent_Windows.md)Â list will display items:

-   **Move focused windows to top**: When this is enabled and you click on any item in the Recent Window list, the selected item will be moved to the top of the list. By default this is disabled.
-   **Display only currently open windows**: Enabling this will make the Recent Windows list remove those items that are no longer open in a workspace (ie: closing any window will remove it from the list too). By default this is disabled.
-   **Maximum windows to display**: This sets the maximum number of previously opened windows that will be shown within the Recent Windows list. Default is 10.
