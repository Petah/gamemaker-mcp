# Start Screen Preferences

![](../../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Preferences/Start_Screen_Preferences.png)The Start Screen Preferences allow you to change how the Start Page behaves. The main options are:

-   **Show Tour**: This allows you to select whether the introductory tour is shown when the IDE is started. This is automatically disabled the first time you skip the tour.
-   **Show Setup Wizard**: This allows you to select whether the Setup Wizard is shown when the IDE is started. The Setup Wizard essentially takes you through the steps necessary to create a new project.
-   **Recent Projects List Style**: This allows you to change the display of the Recent Projects list on the Start Page between "List" and "Grid".
