# Required SDKs

GameMaker itself has no special requirements other than those listed on the [Installing](Installation_Guide.md) page and will install any required dependencies the first time you install the product as part of the package. However if you have any licence other than the _Free_ licence, then you will also be required to set up and maintain the SDK's and other build tools that the export modules for the licence require.

You can find a complete list of the required tools and SDKs per platform from the following link:
