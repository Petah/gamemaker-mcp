# The Asset Editors

GameMaker has a number of different assets that you can create (in [The Asset Browser](../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.md)) which you can edit using each of the specific asset editors listed below.

In the course of development you will need to use some - or even all - of these editors, and remembering what everything does can sometimes be a bit daunting. To help out, you can find each of the different editors listed below, and clicking any of them will take you to a page that explains in detail what it is and how to use it.

There are also [General Asset Editors](../The_IDE/General_Asset_Editors.md) which allow you to edit various types of assets.
